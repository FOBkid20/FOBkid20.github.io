          <h2>Happiness Club</h2>
        </div> 

        <div>
          <p>Over my time in Happiness Club, I have participated in and/or organized nearly a hundred different events and campaigns! That's insane! I began on Smile Senate, our junior executive board, my freshman year, and moved on to become co-President, Laudation Chair, and Secretary. Below is a sample of some of my favorite events.</p>

          <h6>PowerPoint Party</h6>
          <p>Fall 2020<br>
          For this remote, synchronous event, participants were encouraged to make a ~5 minute powerpoint on anything of their choosing to share with the world. Behold a screenshot from my contribution: a How To Draw a Disproportional Horse Tutorial. </p>

          <h6>Pet Costume Contest</h6>
          <p>Fall 2020<br>
          For this remote, asynchronous event, people submitted pictures of their pets in Halloween costumes. Then, we created a bracket where people could vote via our Facebook or Instagram! Our winner (Earl the Taco), Runner-Up (Jack-Jack the Beanie Baby), and other favorites (Juneau the Dino, Chip the Hot Dog, Moose the Ringleader, and Nugget the Shark)</p>

          <h6>Pie A Professor</h6>
          <p>Winter 2018<br>
          For this Pi Day event, we recruited a half dozen professors willing to be pied in the face! We provided whipped cream for the pie-ing, as well as real pie for eating!</p>
