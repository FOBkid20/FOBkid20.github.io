          <h6>Identifying Gender Bias in Movie Reviews</h6>
          <p>This was an independent research project. I worked on replicating <a href = "https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~msap/pdfs/sap2017connotation.pdf">this paper</a> on the connotation frames of agency and power in movie scripts, using movie reviews instead. My results aligned with those found in the paper, indicating that men are more likely to be agentive and powerful, whereas women are likely to be non-agentive.</p>
          <p><b>Skills and Tools: </b> Python, spaCy, Pandas, Regular Expressions, Research</p>

          <h6>Emotion-Specific Text Generation Systems</h6>
          <p>I conducted this project for one of my classes with two partners. I fine-tuned GPT-2 using emotionally-tagged data from various dialogue sources, including the script of the TV show Friends.
          We built six models after the six primary emotions, Joy, Anger, Sadness, Disgust, Fear, and Surprise. I then wrote a program that used these six models in conjunction to produce a multi-part dialogue based on a given emotional arc.</p>
          <p><b>Skills and Tools: </b> Python, GPT-2, Language Modeling, Text Generation, Google CoLab</p>

          <h6>Visualizing Use of Fatal Force by Police</h6>
          <p>I conducted this project for one of my classes. A partner and I used the Washington Post's Fatal Force database to construct an interactive visualization in d3 detailing the race breakdown and locations of fatal police shootings since 2015.

        	<h6>Reddit Opioid Research</h6>
          <p>For this research, I relied on data from two sources. The first was an extensive survey taken by 200 users of opioids. The second was a record of these users' Reddit data in the weeks following the completion of the survey. Working with a partner, I built a Machine Learning pipeline to classify the likelihood of risky behaviors as reported in the survey using Part of Speech and TFIDF as dependent variables on users' Reddit activity. </p>

        	<h6>Amazon Alexa Intern Onboarding</h6>
          <p>During my internship at Amazon, there was an opportunity for interns to participate in an intern hackathon. I formed a group with my close friend Jaedyn Lee and her friend Sean Ylescupidez from Northeastern. Our team, Northweastern, used online tutorials to teach ourselves how to build an Alexa skill. We created a skill using a conversational model that would ask users for their internship start date on first usage and then provide relevant information based on how close their internship was. It also provided a countdown of days until the internship began. See our presentation here:</p>

        	<h6><span id="Bose"></span>Bose Topic Aggregation</h6>
          <p> During my summer internship at Bose, I created a topic aggregation algorithm using word vectors. The basic pipeline involved preprocessing the text data with steps like lemmatization, removing duplicates, and removing stopwords, then encoding the concepts using fasttext vectors (more lightweight to train on specific data than BERT), creating a synonym dictionary based on comparisons of vectors, and then choosing the most representative synonym for the aggregated topic. See a detailed explanation in <a href="Final Presentation.pptx">this presentation.</a> </p>
          <p><b>Skills and Tools: </b> Python, Algorithm Development, Word Embeddings, Natural Language Processing</p>

The categorization service worked on unstructured review data using ElasticSearch. See a detailed explanation in <a href="Final Presentation.pptx">this presentation.</a></p>
          <p><b>Skills and Tools: </b> Python, ElasticSearch, Natural Language Processing, Data Processing</p>

        	<h6>Bose Kibana Trainings</h6>
          <p>While interning at Bose Corporation, I realized that many of the users of the internal natural language processing app owned by my team were unaware of the breadth of capabilities it offered and how to use our product. I created a presentation on how to use the tool, brought it to my team, and offered to give tutorials to stakeholders.  In the process of giving tutorials to teams from Legal to Aviation, I sought direct insights from our customers about what data was most useful to them and which upcoming features they were most excited about. These presentations increased usage of my team’s tool and clarified direction for further development. I also created dashboards for various teams using our tool. </p>
