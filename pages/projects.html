        <div>
          <p><center>On this page, I like to keep track of the projects that I have spent time on. It is currently divided into three sections: Computer Science, Performing, and Other. Each of these sections is ordered roughly chronologically, although of course I frequently had several projects running concurrently. I have included some of my favorite school projects, as well as extracurricular projects, work projects, and hobbies.</center></p>

          <h4>Computer Science</h4>

        	<h6>Reddit Opioid Research</h6>
          <p>For this research, I relied on data from two sources. The first was an extensive survey taken by 200 users of opioids. The second was a record of these users' Reddit data in the weeks following the completion of the survey. Working with a partner, I built a Machine Learning pipeline to classify the likelihood of risky behaviors as reported in the survey using Part of Speech and TFIDF as dependent variables on users' Reddit activity. </p>

        	<h6>Chicago Police Home Invasions Project</h6>
          <p>I conducted this project for my Data Science Seminar in a group with Mandy Davis and Brendon Eby. The full project is available publicly on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Northwestern-Data-Sci-Seminar/Invisible-Institute-Chicago-Reporter-Collaboration-Public/tree/master/The%20Storm%20Panthers">here.</a> This project was undertaken for Jennie Rogers' Fall 2020 Data Science seminar. We used data from the Chicago Police Department to analyze the department's record with home invasions.</p>

        	<h6>Mentoring</h6>
          <p>I am currently mentoring two lovely students in Computer Science. Through Rewriting the Code, where I am a fellow, I am mentoring Katie Taylor. Through Northwestern's Women in Computing program, I am mentoring Amy Wang. I meet with each of them for around an hour to ninety minutes biweekly.</p>

          <h6>Florida SNAP Recipients</h6>
          <p>I analyzed data about Florida's food stamps program to identify areas of improvement. See my final analysis here: <a href="../Florida_SNAP.docx"> SNAP Analysis. </a> </p>

          <h6>Siri Project Proposal</h6>
          <p>I created a proposal for a new Siri feature: a 20 questions game. See my final proposal here: <a href="../Siri Project Proposal.pdf"> Proposal. </a> </p>

        	<h6>Amazon Alexa Intern Onboarding</h6>
          <p>During my internship at Amazon, there was an opportunity for interns to participate in an intern hackathon. I formed a group with my close friend Jaedyn Lee and her friend Sean Ylescupidez from Northeastern. Our team, Northweastern, used online tutorials to teach ourselves how to build an Alexa skill. We created a skill using a conversational model that would ask users for their internship start date on first usage and then provide relevant information based on how close their internship was. It also provided a countdown of days until the internship began. See our presentation here:</p>

        	<h6>Amazon Latency Tool</h6>
          <p>During my 12 week summer internship at Amazon, I owned the development of a tool enhancement with an existing Java codebase to provide more accurate and granular latency metrics for Fire TV devices from user research to design to implementation. I provided a React frontend visualization to minimize developer time seeking root cause for latency issues.</p>

        	<h6>Affective Agent</h6>
          <p>For my Affective Computing class, our class jointly worked to build an affective conversational agent. I worked on text processing to analyze the mood of the speaker. See the GitHub page for my portion of the project <a href="https://github.com/vbursztyn/affective-computing-nlu/graphs/contributors"> here.</a></p>

        	<h6>Recipe Transformer</h6>
          <p>For my Natural Language Processing class, I worked with my group to create a recipe transformer, which was able to take in recipes (from AllRecipes.com) and modify them according to various specifications - for instance cuisine. See the GitHub page for this project <a href="https://github.com/FOBkid20/Project2_Recipe"> here.</a></p>

        	<h6>Golden Globes Tweet Parser</h6>
          <p>For my Natural Language Processing class, I worked with my group to create a program which was able to take in large volumes of Twitter data and from there identify key Golden Globes-related information, such as Presenters, Nominees, and Winners of various categories. Our solution was ranked third of 27 solutions. See the GitHub page for this project <a href="https://github.com/FOBkid20/NLP_Project1"> here.</a></p>

        	<h6>Bose Topic Aggregation</h6>
          <p> During my summer internship at Bose, I created a topic aggregation algorithm using word vectors. The basic pipeline involved preprocessing the text data with steps like lemmatization, removing duplicates, and removing stopwords, then encoding the concepts using fasttext vectors (more lightweight to train on specific data than BERT), creating a synonym dictionary based on comparisons of vectors, and then choosing the most representative synonym for the aggregated topic. See a detailed explanation in <a href="Final Presentation.pptx">this presentation.</a> </p>

        	<h6>Bose Wishlist</h6>
          <p>At Bose, I owned the creation of a wishlist feature for our product. This used a rule-based classifier to identify "wishlists" for different products based on product reviews, e.g. "bluetooth" or "more colors". The categorization service worked on unstructured review data using ElasticSearch. See a detailed explanation in <a href="Final Presentation.pptx">this presentation.</a></p>

        	<h6>Bose Kibana Trainings</h6>
          <p>While interning at Bose Corporation, I realized that many of the users of the internal natural language processing app owned by my team were unaware of the breadth of capabilities it offered and how to use our product. I created a presentation on how to use the tool, brought it to my team, and offered to give tutorials to stakeholders.  In the process of giving tutorials to teams from Legal to Aviation, I sought direct insights from our customers about what data was most useful to them and which upcoming features they were most excited about. These presentations increased usage of my team’s tool and clarified direction for further development. I also created dashboards for various teams using our tool. </p>

          <h6>Fam!</h6>
          <p>I led a team in developing an iPhone app to store and calculate users’ family relations. I worked as Project Lead and on frontend, using React Native. I led a team of five freshmen and sophomores through the design and creation of a family tree app, including conducting user research, iterating through designs, and building out an app prototype.  Despite our inexperience and small team, our team won first place in the competition thanks largely to our focus on customer needs. See the GitHub page for this project <a href="https://github.com/Mark-Jung/family-tree">here.</a> </p>

        	<h6>FamJam</h6>
          <p>I was a research assistant on the FamJam! making project of TIILT lab. I facilitated projects among families using technological tools like 3D pens and paper circuits and took field notes. This included travelling to a Makers' Fair, where I demonstrated the technology to children. </p>

        	<h6>HeartBeat</h6>
          <p>For a hackathon, I designed and built a website with a team of two others that provides a Spotify playlist customized by users’ moods, which can be determined by facial recognition. Technologies used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Cloud Platform, Google Vision, Python, and Flask. We won Best Design. See the GitHub page for this project <a href="https://github.com/FOBkid20/Mood-Playlist-Generator">here.</a> </p>

        	<h6>Lodo Internship</h6>
          <p>During my summer internship with Lodo Therapeutics, I independently designed and implemented packages and tools in R for data processing and data visualization, employing regular expressions and Shiny, identifying over 4,500 data inconsistencies and correcting nearly 3000. I worked with devOps team to expand version control (git), continuous integration (Drone), and cloud storage (AWS) processes. Additionally, I got the chance to work in the lab. I conducted supervised lab work: executed PCR, restriction digest, ligation, and transformation. See my breakdown of my work here: <a href="Linting1.docx"> Blog 1 </a> &nbsp;and here: <a href="Linting2.docx"> Blog 2.</a></p>

          <h6>Personal Website</h6>
          <p>You are currently on my personal website! I created this website from scratch using HTML and CSS in 2018 and have been updating it now and again over the years since! To take a look behind the scenes, visit the GitHub page here: <a href="https://github.com/FOBkid20/FOBkid20.github.io">Website GitHub.</a></p>

        	<h6>ThoughtJar</h6>
          <p>For the BuildHer 2018 Hackathon, I designed and built an iPhone app in React Native with a team of three others that provides users with a daily positive thought and space to reflect. We won Best Beginner Hack. See the GitHub page for this project <a href="https://github.com/mikaylab/ThoughtJar"> here.</a></p>
