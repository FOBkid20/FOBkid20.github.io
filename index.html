            <p>
            Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Lexi Jen Ryan, and I am a senior at Northwestern University. I am currently pursuing a BA degree in Computer Science and Linguistics. My interests lie in natural language processing and machine learning.</p>
            <p>I hail from Southborough, Massachusetts. Between high school and college, I took a gap year in Manhattan studying musical theatre performance. Though I decided not to continue with theatre, I did fall in love with the Big Apple, and will be returning beginning August 2021 in my new role at BNY Mellon as a Product Management Analyst. </p>
            <p>Outside of computer science, here are some things I enjoy, in no particular order:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Disney</li>
              <li>Pasta</li>
              <li>Musical Theatre</li>
              <li>Spending time with friends and family</li> 
              <li>Classic Literature</li>
              <li>Cute Animals</li>
              <li>Not-Cute Animals</li>
